Installation
============

The preferred method of installation is using [Pathogen][pathogen].  Then
simply run

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/hhvm/vim-hack.git

The Hack syntax file assumes that you are using the default PHP syntax file
that ships with Vim 7.4, or a compatible file.
