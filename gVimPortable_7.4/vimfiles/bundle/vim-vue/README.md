# vim-vue

Vim syntax highlighting for [Vue
components](http://vuejs.org/guide/application.html#Single_File_Components).

This was initially forked from
[darthmall/vim-vue](https://github.com/darthmall/vim-vue). I already have an
implementation for this but found his code much cleaner. That's why I created a
new version instead of a PR.

## Installation

### Install with [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)

`Plugin 'posva/vim-vue'`

## Contributing

If your language is not getting highlighted open an issue or a PR with the fix.
You only need to add some lines to the `syntax/vue.vim` file.
