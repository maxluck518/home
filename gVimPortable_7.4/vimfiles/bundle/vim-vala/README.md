# vim-vala

vim-vala is a Vim syntax, indent and ftdetect files for Vala. 
It is mainly from
[https://live.gnome.org/Vala/Vim](https://live.gnome.org/Vala/Vim). [^1]

[^1]: I first tried to import from https://github.com/rainux/vim-vala, 
but noticed that the vala.vim from http://live.gnome.org/Vala/Vim is 
in active development and the LastChange is in 2012/2, while rainux/vim-vala
is somewhat old, so I decided to directly import vala.vim from 
http://live.gnome.org/Vala/Vim.
